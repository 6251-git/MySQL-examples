This table is wirtten to show the top ten most populated cities in the world. I made sure to include the country code next to the city name  to make sure that viewer can see which country the city is located. The table is also orderd by population descending to ensure that the largest population is at the top.

Similar to the previous table with the difference being that it only displays cities with population counts between two numbers.

All of the cities, displayed in alphabetic order. There is too many rows in this table to fit into the screenshot but you can still see that its been ordered that way regardless.

similar to the previous table, this table lists out all of the cities in the world with names that begin with "Be", again ordered by population descending.

Explanation

Each of these screenshots display different SQL codes meant display the many different ways in which I know how to display, categorise and order sets of data in to tables using MySQL. This is to provide potential employers with a sense of my ability to code in SQL during the interviewing process.
